    <b>Let's Authenticate: Automated Certificates for User Authentication</b><br>

    <em>Abstract:</em>Passwords have numerous drawbacks, and as a result many systems have been designed to replace them. Password replacements have generally failed to dislodge passwords due to the complexity of balancing usability, deployability, and security. However, despite this lack of success, recent advances with password managers and FIDO2 afford new opportunities to explore system design for password replacements. In this work, we explore the feasibility of a system for user authentication based on certificates. Rather than developing new cryptography, we develop a new *system*, called Let's Authenticate, which combines elements of password managers, FIDO2, and certificates. Our design incorporates feedback from a survey of 397 participants to understand their preferences for system features. Let’s Authenticate issues privacy-preserving certificates to users, automatically manages their credentials, and eliminates trust in third parties. We provide a detailed security and privacy analysis, an overhead analysis, and a systematic comparison of the system to a variety of alternatives using a well-known framework. We discuss how Let’s Authenticate compares to other systems, lessons learned from our design, and issues related to centralized management of authentication data.

    <i>Abstract:</i> The FIDO2 Alliance is proposing standards for cryptographic authentication that are intended to replace passwords. We show that their standards could lead to difficult registration, cumbersome account recovery, and potential privacy leaks and tracking. We propose an alternative architecture based on certificates instead of bare keys that provides automatic registration and login and simplified account recovery. We use a framework to compare our approach to related work, illustrating usability, security, and privacy trade-offs.

		<i>Abstract:</i> Engineering education is undergoing major shifts to both accommodate the challenges it faces and also to embrace the unprecedented opportunities. One of the trends, identified by Froyd et al., shows a renewed focus on design as the major and distinctive element of engineering education. In particular, more and more schools are interested in design teams to be comprised of students from different programs. The advantages of this composition is obvious, yet the main issue is to find proper problems or projects where student talent and knowledge can best mesh and produce.<br><br>

	<i>Abstract:</i> Open source microcontroller (MCU) boards have made significant inroads towards classroom teaching over the last decade. Many programs have already switched from the traditional educational boards to, for example Arduino products, due to their low costs, easy to use, flexibility, and wide adoption in both consumer and industrial applications. However, comparing with their commercial counterparts, open source boards still lack rigorous and well-designed teaching, especially lab materials to have a seamless integration with existing curricular. Engine systems and controls is a core course in automotive engineering (AET) program that teaches students the theory and application of on-board diagnostics and monitoring system. The course has an intense lab component. Despite the consensus that AET curriculum needs more mechatronics material to reflect the critical roles that electrical, electronics, computing, communications, controls and software technologies play in today's vehicles, we find that nationwide, the lab facility of automotive programs are still heavily mechanical. We believe open source MCU boards are the ideal tool to develop new educational equipment and materials to transform automotive labs and to bridge the gap between classroom and industry knowledge base. In this work-in-progress paper we first introduce the Arduino shields for engine sensing and communication that we have designed at the request of, and in collaboration with AET faculty. We then present the assessment plan to evaluate the boards' effectiveness in helping students understand fundamental mechatronics concepts and practices, and their impact on students' learning experience for engineering design in a multi-disciplinary team.
