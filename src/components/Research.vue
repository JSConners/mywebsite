    <b>Let's Authenticate: Automated Cryptographic Authentication for the Web with Simple Account Recovery</b> <br>

    <i>Abstract:</i> The FIDO2 Alliance is proposing standards for cryptographic authentication that are intended to replace passwords. We show that their standards could lead to difficult registration, cumbersome account recovery, and potential privacy leaks and tracking. We propose an alternative architecture based on certificates instead of bare keys that provides automatic registration and login and simplified account recovery. We use a framework to compare our approach to related work, illustrating usability, security, and privacy trade-offs.

    <b> A Review and Analysis of Rehabilitative and Industrial Exoskeletons</b> <br>
    <i>Abstract:</i> This paper takes a look at exoskeletons in their current form. Exoskeleton is defined as it is used in the context of this paper. Some of the topics covered within are industry and medical standards, a look at the bone structure, muscle groups, and mathematics behind walking. A brief opinion based analysis of three exoskeletons is also included. I look at each of these as they would be used for rehabilitation of lower limb injuries, but since I cannot cover all injuries in the context of this paper, it was narrowed to injuries of the knee, specifically ligament tears. In the end, I found that we can safely assume that much more work needs to be done when considering using an exoskeleton as a part of rehabilitation in sports injuries. Current models simply do not have the proper harnesses to support a multitude of injuries, and this leads me into a project that I will take forward, which is attempting to create a lightweight exoskeleton that would support any number of injuries, in order to drastically reduce rehabilitation.

		<b>Improving Teaching Effectiveness of Automotive Sensing and Communication using Customized Signal Conditioning Circuits</b> <br>

		<i>Abstract:</i> Engineering education is undergoing major shifts to both accommodate the challenges it faces and also to embrace the unprecedented opportunities. One of the trends, identified by Froyd et al., shows a renewed focus on design as the major and distinctive element of engineering education. In particular, more and more schools are interested in design teams to be comprised of students from different programs. The advantages of this composition is obvious, yet the main issue is to find proper problems or projects where student talent and knowledge can best mesh and produce.<br><br>

		<b>Assessing the Use of Open Source Microcontroller Board for Teaching Engine Sensing and Communication in Automotive Laboratory</b>

	<i>Abstract:</i> Open source microcontroller (MCU) boards have made significant inroads towards classroom teaching over the last decade. Many programs have already switched from the traditional educational boards to, for example Arduino products, due to their low costs, easy to use, flexibility, and wide adoption in both consumer and industrial applications. However, comparing with their commercial counterparts, open source boards still lack rigorous and well-designed teaching, especially lab materials to have a seamless integration with existing curricular. Engine systems and controls is a core course in automotive engineering (AET) program that teaches students the theory and application of on-board diagnostics and monitoring system. The course has an intense lab component. Despite the consensus that AET curriculum needs more mechatronics material to reflect the critical roles that electrical, electronics, computing, communications, controls and software technologies play in today's vehicles, we find that nationwide, the lab facility of automotive programs are still heavily mechanical. We believe open source MCU boards are the ideal tool to develop new educational equipment and materials to transform automotive labs and to bridge the gap between classroom and industry knowledge base. In this work-in-progress paper we first introduce the Arduino shields for engine sensing and communication that we have designed at the request of, and in collaboration with AET faculty. We then present the assessment plan to evaluate the boards' effectiveness in helping students understand fundamental mechatronics concepts and practices, and their impact on students' learning experience for engineering design in a multi-disciplinary team.
